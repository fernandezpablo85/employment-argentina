# What's this?

The INDEC (meaning "Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica y Censos", or National Institute of Statistics and Census) just [published a report](http://www.indec.gob.ar/uploads/informesdeprensa/erl_10_16.pdf) on Argentinan labor and workforce.

Although the data is great, the visualization is lacking.

We'll try to fix that, while keeping the data, the tools and the process open for everyone to audit, learn and criticise.
